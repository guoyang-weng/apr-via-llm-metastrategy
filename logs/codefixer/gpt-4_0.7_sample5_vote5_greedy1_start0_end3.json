Since the context code is necessary to understand the entire working of the function, Choices 3 and 4 are less informative.\n\nBetween Choices 1, 2, and 5, all are identical, so any of them would be a correct choice.\n\nThe best choice is 1.",

            "The faulty line is \"vals.append((vals.pop(), ops.pop(), vals.pop()))\". The problem here is that the order of popping values from the stack is incorrect. In Python, the pop() method removes the last item in the list, which means the right operand is being popped before the left operand. This could lead to incorrect results in calculations. The line should be corrected to \"vals.append((vals.pop(-2), ops.pop(), vals.pop()))\" to correctly retrieve the left operand first.    # pylint: disable=redefined-outer-name\ndef arithm_expr_parse_verA(line_tokens):\n    \"\"\"Constructs an arithmetic expression tree\n    :param line_tokens: list of token strings containing the expression\n    :returns: expression tree\n    :complexity: linear\n    \"\"\"\n    vals = []\n    ops = []\n    for tok in line_tokens + [';']:\n        if tok in PRIORITY:  # tok is an operator\n            while (tok != '(' and ops and\n                   PRIORITY[ops[-1]] >= PRIORITY[tok]):\n                vals.append((vals.pop(-2), ops.pop(), vals.pop()))\n            if tok == ')':\n                ops.pop()    # this is the corresponding '('\n            else:\n                ops.append(tok)\n        elif tok.isdigit():  # tok is an integer\n            vals.append(int(tok))\n        else:                # tok is an identifier\n            vals.append(tok)\n    return vals.pop()\n\n###The following code is context, no change required###\n# def arithm_expr_eval_verA(cell, expr):\n#     \"\"\"Evaluates a given expression\n#     :param expr: expression\n#     :param cell: dictionary variable name -> expression\n#     :returns: numerical value of expression\n#     :complexity: linear\n#     \"\"\"\n#     if isinstance(expr, tuple):\n#         (left, operand, right) = expr\n#         lval = arithm_expr_eval_verA(cell, left)\n#         rval = arithm_expr_eval_verA(cell, right)\n#         if operand == '+':\n#             return lval + rval\n#         if operand == '-':\n#             return lval - rval\n#         if operand == '*':\n#             return lval * rval\n#         if operand == '/':\n#             return lval // rval\n#     elif isinstance(expr, int):\n#         return expr\n#     else:\n#         cell[expr] = arithm_expr_eval_verA(cell, cell[expr])\n#         return cell[expr]\n\n# PRIORITY = {';': 0, '(': 1, ')': 2, '-': 3, '+': 3, '*': 4, '/': 4}\n\n###Unit test to be passed, should not be changed###\n# import unittest\n# class TestTryalgo(unittest.TestCase):\n#     def test_arithm_expr_eval_verA(self):\n#         L = [(\"13 + A47 * ZZ22\", 37),\n#              (\"( 12 - 2 ) * 5\", 50),\n#              (\"4 / 7 + 4 / 7\", 0),\n#              (\"3 * 3 / 7\", 1),\n#              (\"12\", 12)]\n#         for str_expr, val in L:\n#             cell = {\"ZZ22\": 3, \"A47\": 8}\n#             expr = arithm_expr_parse_verA(str_expr.split())\n#             self.assertEqual(arithm_expr_eval_verA(cell, expr), val)"
