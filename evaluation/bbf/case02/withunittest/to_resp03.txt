The code provided seems to be an attempt at the Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting. However, it is incorrectly implemented. The correct algorithm works as follows:

- Create a set of all nodes with no incoming edge (in the current code, this part is correct).
- While this set is non-empty, remove a node n from it.
- Insert n into the tail of the output list (in the current code, this part is also correct).
- For each node m with an edge e from n to m, remove edge e from the graph. If m has no other incoming edges, insert m into the set.
- Continue until the set is empty.

The provided code is not removing edges and is not updating the set of nodes with no incoming edges correctly. The updated code reflecting the above algorithm is as follows:

```python
def topological_ordering(nodes):
    ordered_nodes = [node for node in nodes if not node.incoming_nodes]
    i = 0
    while i < len(ordered_nodes):
        node = ordered_nodes[i]
        for nextnode in list(node.outgoing_nodes):
            nextnode.incoming_nodes.remove(node)
            node.outgoing_nodes.remove(nextnode)
            if not nextnode.incoming_nodes and nextnode not in ordered_nodes:
                ordered_nodes.append(nextnode)
        i += 1
    return ordered_nodes
```

In this code, we iterate over a copy of node.outgoing_nodes because we're modifying the list while iterating over it, which can cause issues. The iterator i is used to iterate over ordered_nodes, because the length of ordered_nodes can change during the loop (new nodes can be appended), so a for loop would not work correctly. We increase i manually in each iteration.
