The bug in the code is that the last remaining part of the text is not added to the list of lines when the length of the text is less than or equal to the specified number of columns. This can be fixed by appending the remaining text to the list of lines after the while loop:

```python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
        lines.append(line)
    if text:
        lines.append(text)
    return lines
```
