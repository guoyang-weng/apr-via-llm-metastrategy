The bug in the code is that it does not handle the case when the remaining part of the text is less than or equal to the number of columns specified. This piece of text is not being added to the lines list. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:].lstrip()
        lines.append(line)

    if text:
        lines.append(text)

    return lines
```

In this corrected code, after the while loop, we add the remaining text to the lines list if there is any. Also, we use `lstrip()` to remove leading spaces from the remaining text after splitting.
