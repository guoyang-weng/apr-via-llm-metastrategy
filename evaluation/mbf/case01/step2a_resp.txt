The bug is in the while loop condition. The loop stops when the length of the remaining text is less than or equal to the number of columns. But it doesn't add the remaining text to the list of lines. This is why the last line of the text is missing in the actual output. The bug can be fixed by adding the remaining text to the list of lines after the while loop. The faulty line is "while len(text) > cols:".
def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
        lines.append(line)

    if text:
        lines.append(text)

    return lines
