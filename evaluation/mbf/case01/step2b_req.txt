Given an instruction and several choices, decide which choice is most promising. Analyze each choice in detail, then conclude in the last line "The best choice is {s}", where s the integer id of the choice.

Instruction: You will be provided with a piece of Python code, and your task is to find and fix bugs in it.

Buggy code:

def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
        lines.append(line)

    return lines
###input###
#text = "The leaves did not stir on the trees, grasshoppers chirruped, and the monotonous hollow sound of the sea rising up from below, spoke of the peace, of the eternal sleep awaiting us. So it must have sounded when there was no Yalta, no Oreanda here; so it sounds now, and it will sound as indifferently and monotonously when we are all no more. And in this constancy, in this complete indifference to the life and death of each of us, there lies hid, perhaps, a pledge of our eternal salvation, of the unceasing movement of life upon earth, of unceasing progress towards perfection. Sitting beside a young woman who in the dawn seemed so lovely, soothed and spellbound in these magical surroundings - the sea, mountains, clouds, the open sky - Gurov thought how in reality everything is beautiful in this world when one reflects: everything except what we think or do ourselves when we forget our human dignity and the higher aims of our existence."

#cols = 50

Choice 1:
The bug is in the while loop condition. The loop stops when the length of the remaining text is less than or equal to the number of columns. But it doesn't add the remaining text to the list of lines. This is why the last line of the text is missing in the actual output. The bug can be fixed by adding the remaining text to the list of lines after the while loop. The faulty line is "while len(text) > cols:".def wrap(text, cols):
    lines = []
    while len(text) > cols:
        end = text.rfind(' ', 0, cols + 1)
        if end == -1:
            end = cols
        line, text = text[:end], text[end:]
